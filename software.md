### Research

* [**Bayesian Optimization Library**](https://github.com/toscanosaul/stratified_bayesian_optimization)<br>
This library is a Bayesian global optimization framework written in Python, which includes a new proposed algorithm that leads to
state-of-the-art performance when the objective function is noisy. The library includes diverse applications such as
training convolutional neural networks and recommender systems, and realistic examples based on a
queuing and inventory problem simulation.
